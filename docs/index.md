## Getting Started

First, [install cmake-lint]() on your system. The executable must be in your
`PATH`. Second, install the extension through the
[VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brobeson.vscode-cmake-lint).
VS Code activates the extension when you open a CMake file.

## Running CMake-Lint

VS Code CMake-Lint scans your file when you save it.
